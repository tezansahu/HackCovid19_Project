## HelpingHand 
### Problem Statement 
In the current scenario of the world, given the outbreak of COVID-19, people are forced to go into lockdown. In such a scenario, daily life comes to a stop as routines are disturbed. Procuring daily supplies is difficult and home bound patients who need assistance are helpless. People have been asking help through varied platforms and some have also offered help. HelpingHand is an interface that brifges the gap and brings together these people as it suggests, lends a hand, to fight this pandemic.
